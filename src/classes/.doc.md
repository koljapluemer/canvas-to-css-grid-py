## Grid

A per-cell representation of what's going on, can actually directly handle data like 

```
a a · b b b
a a 1 1 1 1
· 0 · · · 1
· 0 0 0 · 1
· · · c c 1
```

Is basically a helper class for `ObjectManager` and gets created ad-hoc when needed.

It does not have the full required info. 
For example, in the string above it's extremely hard to decipher to which nodes
the "1" edge connects. And of course, node content and edge labels aren't saved.

Can however be created standalone, and provides functions such as "which cells are free"
and handles row clones and stuff like that. The info is then fed back to `ObjectManager`.

## Cell

The class for each cell in the `Grid`.

## ObjectManager

Holds a reference to nodes and edges. 
The SSoT.

## Node

Dataclass holding info about a node, including position and size.

## Edge

Little dataclass holding all info about an edge between two `Node`s.


## Coordinate

More like a type, really — standardizes 2D Array access
