The final boss.

When drawing in edge paths, it's inevitable that edges cross.
This should probably be punished, but it cannot be avoided, otherwise a lot of diagrams are simply impossible to render.

Fancy edge cells (e.g. "→") cannot be crossed. We're not going down that road.
There are in fact only two cases where edge cells can be crossed by another:

- A "│" cell, by an edge that comes from the side.
- A "─" cell, by an edge that comes in from above or below.

Then, how should this be represented?

- In `flow txt`: "┼"
- In normal `txt`, I'm not sure
- In `JSON`, the cell is simply in the cell arrays of two different edges

There is also a slight question of how to elegantly detect this, and store this, b/c of the two challenges:

1. This breaks neatness of quite a bit of data structure, e.g. a Cell was so for directly related to either nothing, exactly one node, or exactly one edge
2. A cell *may* be crossed once, but if it is crossed, it can definitely not be crossed again. That is non-trivial state.
