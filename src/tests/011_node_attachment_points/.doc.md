# Attachment Points

An attachment point is a cell adjacent to a node where an edge may start or end.

It's based on node neighbors (see prev. test folder) but it has one extra condition:

For a point to be valid, it needs *another* empty cell in the same direction as breathing space.

For example, if we're connecting on top of a node (N direction), this would be a valid attachment point (marked `p`)

```
· 
p 
a
```

However, if it looks like this, there is no valid attachment point at all:


```
b
·
a
```
