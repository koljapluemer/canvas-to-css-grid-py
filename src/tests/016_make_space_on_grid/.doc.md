If there is not space to add a node, trace a path or even attach a path to a node that misses an edge, we must extend the grid by adding cols/rows, or cloning them.

- Rows and columns can be simply added to the end (new last column/last row). This changes grid dimension, but does not require moving any nodes
- Rows and columns can also be added to the beginning. This also works always. However, this changes the coordinates of every existing col and row.
- Rows and columns can also, in some circumstances, be cloned
  - First, it must be detected which rows/cols can be cloned
    - A row can can be cloned if _all_ of its cells are nodes, empty, or vertical edge cells without an arrow ("|")
    - A column can be cloned if _all_ of the cells in it are nodes, empty, or horizontal edge cells without an arrow ("â”€")
  - Cloning works by simply adding the the col/row again after its current index
  - Doing such a clone influences dimensions and position of nodes (and their cells) and edge cells at or after the cloned row/col. These must be adapted.
