After everything is done, we probably end up with a lot of rows/cols that are redundant. For example

```
a a 路 b b b b
a a 路 b b b b
a a 路 b b b b
```

All of these rows are redundant, and should be smelted down to a single row.
There are also quite a few redundant cols (cols that are exactly repeated to the right).

After pruning, this grid shoud look like:

```
a 路 b
```
